CST8504 – Assignment 3
Student: <YOUR NAME>, <STUDENT NUMBER>
Repository: https://github.com/18lily2018/assignment-2-ros-2-and-vision-18lily2018

-------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-------------------------------------------------------
This assignment extends my ROS 2 workspace from Assignment 2 by adding
hearing and speaking functionality. The workspace now includes the
following Python-based ROS 2 packages:

  • aisd_motion     – motion control (from Assignment 2)
  • aisd_vision     – vision / hand-tracking (from Assignment 2)
  • aisd_msgs       – custom message/service definitions
  • aisd_hearing    – hearing-related nodes (Assignment 3)
  • aisd_speaking   – speaking-related nodes (Assignment 3)
  • aisd_create3_lab5 – Create3 lab package (Lab 5)

All packages live under the src/ directory of my ros2_ws_clean workspace.

-------------------------------------------------------
2. Build Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------
Workspace root (on my VM):

  ~/ros2_ws_clean

To build:

  cd ~/ros2_ws_clean
  colcon build

Then source:

  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source ~/ros2_ws_clean/install/setup.bash

-------------------------------------------------------
3. Running the Assignment 3 Nodes
-------------------------------------------------------
After building and sourcing as above, the nodes can be run with ros2 run.

Example (adjust node names if different in setup.py):

  # Terminal 1 – Hearing: recording_publisher
  cd ~/ros2_ws_clean
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run aisd_hearing recording_publisher

  # Terminal 2 – Hearing: words_publisher
  cd ~/ros2_ws_clean
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run aisd_hearing words_publisher

  # Terminal 3 – Speaking service
  cd ~/ros2_ws_clean
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run aisd_speaking speak

  # Terminal 4 – Speak client
  cd ~/ros2_ws_clean
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run aisd_hearing speak_client

This matches the structure in the assignment (hearing nodes plus speaking
service and client).

4. Package Summary
-------------------------------------------------------

aisd_motion
  - Motion-related nodes (e.g., controlling a robot using Twist messages).
  - Reused from Assignment 2 with no breaking changes.

aisd_vision
  - Vision / hand-tracking nodes that publish messages using aisd_msgs.
  - Reused from Assignment 2.

aisd_msgs
  - Defines the custom message/service types used by the motion, vision,
    hearing, and speaking nodes.

aisd_hearing
  - New for Assignment 3.
  - Implements recording_publisher: records microphone audio and publishes
    data to be processed.
  - Implements words_publisher: processes recordings and publishes
    recognized/decoded words.
  - Implements speak_client: client node that calls the Speak service
    provided by aisd_speaking.

aisd_speaking
  - New for Assignment 3.
  - Provides the Speak service node (e.g., using gTTS/pydub) which receives
    a text request and plays audio in response.

aisd_create3_lab5
  - Lab 5 package (Create3).
  - Included in src/ as part of my complete workspace but not required to
    mark Assignment 3 code directly.

-------------------------------------------------------
5. Notes
-------------------------------------------------------
  - build/, install/, log/, and recordings/ directories are not part of the
    submission; they are regenerated by colcon build and at runtime.
  - All testing and demo steps were done on the provided school ROS 2 VM.
